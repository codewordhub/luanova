[Lua](http://lua.org) is a light-weight scripting language developed at PUC-Rio in Brazil. <em>"The simplest thing that could possibly work"</em> is the mantra of the Lua founders, and it shows.

Originally designed for people who weren't professional programmers, the syntax is straight-forward with only a few constructs providing quite a lot of power.

Lua provides a set of mechanisms to do Self/prototype-like object-oriented programming, as well as many traits of functional programming. I believe it is a good language to learn more about computer programming.

<strong>Lua nova,</strong> which is Portuguese for <strong><em>new moon</em></strong>, is to be an exposition of resources found and experiments done while learning from Lua. I say <em>learning from,</em> because it's not only about learning the language, but also software architecture and how principles can be applied across to other programming languages.

I hope you enjoy your stay... ~ Nathan.
